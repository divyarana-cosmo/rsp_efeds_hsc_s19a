# Splashback radius measurements around the eROSITA eFEDS X-ray clusters using Subaru HSC S19A optical galaxy data
Here we are providing the measurements for cross-correlation as well as weak lensing computed used in our research publication: 'ARXIV LINK'

We provide the measurements with associated covariances
- Cross-correlation: 'rsp2d_meas.dat' is the measurements, and 'cov_rsp2d.dat' is the covariance.
- Weak lensing: 'wl_meas.dat' is the measurements, and 'cov_wl.dat' is the covariance.

Each of the measurement files has three columns
1. Comoving projected radial bin - 'rbin[h-1 Mpc]' in units of hinv Mpc.
2. Signal measurement values - 'xi_2d' or 'delta_sigma'.
3. The third column gives the associated 1 sigma errors.

The cross-correlation measurements are for Figure 4, and weak lensing is for the top panel in Figure 2 in the paper. The Weak lensing measurements 'delta_sigma' are in units of (hinv Msun/pc^2).
