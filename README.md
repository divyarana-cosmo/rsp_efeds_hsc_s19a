# Measuring splashback radius around the eROSITA eFEDS X-ray clusters using Subaru HSC S19A optical galaxy data 
Here we are providing the measurements for cross correlation as well as weak lensing computed used in our research publication: 'ARXIV LINK' 
We provide the measurements with associated covariances
- Cross-correlation: 1) 'rsp2d_meas.dat' is the measurements  and 2) 'cov_rsp2d.dat' is the covariance
- Weak lensing: 1) 'wl_meas.dat' is the measurements  and 2) 'cov_wl.dat' is the covariance

Each of the measument files have three columns 
1. Comoving projected radial bin - 'rbin[h-1 Mpc]' in units of hinv Mpc, 
2. Signal measurement values - 'xi_2d' or 'delta_sigma' 
3. The third column gives the associated errors.

The cross correlation measurements are for Figure '' and weak lensing are for the top panel in Figure '' in the paper. The Weak lensing measurements 'delta_sigma'are in units of (hinv Msun/pc^2).
